# UNIFIED STANDALONE DEPLOYMENT
# =============================
# This configuration runs the complete Server Guard application in a single container.
# Includes: React Frontend + All Backend Microservices
# - API Gateway (main entry point, handles external requests)
# - Ingest Service (telemetry ingestion)
# - Detection Engine (rule-based + ML anomaly detection)
# - Alert Manager (alert generation and routing)
# - Response Engine (automated incident response / SOAR)
# - Model Service (ML models for threat detection)
# - Frontend (React dashboard served via nginx)
