#
# UNIFIED SINGLE-CONTAINER DEPLOYMENT
# ====================================
# This configuration runs all backend services in a single container.
# Services communicate via localhost, solving connectivity issues on free tier.
# The container runs: API Gateway, Ingest, Detection, Alert, Response, and Model services.

  # UNIFIED BACKEND - All Services in One Container
  # ============================================
  # This single container runs all backend microservices:
  # - API Gateway (main entry point, handles external requests)
  # - Ingest Service (telemetry ingestion)
  # - Detection Engine (rule-based + ML anomaly detection)
  # - Alert Manager (alert generation and routing)
  # - Response Engine (automated incident response / SOAR)
  # - Model Service (ML models for threat detection)
  #
  # All services communicate via localhost, eliminating
  # inter-service connectivity issues on Render free tier.
